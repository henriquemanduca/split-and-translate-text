There was truth and there was untruth.

And if you clung to the truth,
even against the whole world,

you were not mad.

Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell

is one of the most impactful
books ever written.

It has been widely used and
misused in political discourse

by all kinds of ideologues.

Into that discourse,

it entered terms like Big
Brother, thoughtcrime,

doublethink, newspeak,
Thought Police, and Orwellian.

Strangely enough,

as a synonym for the very thing

that the author Orwell was against.

It's been translated in over 65 languages,

has sold over 30 million copies,

has been banned in many countries,

especially authoritarian regimes.

It's been banned under Stalin

and as recently as 2022 in Belarus.

In this video I'll give a
quick summary with spoilers,

and a few takeaways.

I'd like to try to make it
somewhat interesting to people

who both have and have not read the book.

Let's see how it goes.

The world in the book Nineteen Eighty-Four

is a dystopian future society, nation,

maybe you can say super
state named Oceania.

It's fully controlled by a
totalitarian political party

called Ingsoc.

It's led by Big Brother,
who as we might discuss,

may or may not be a real person.

He might just be as
symbol used by the Party.

The Party wants only
to increase its power,

also something we might talk about.

It uses technology, telescreens
for mass surveillance.

It's creating a new
language called Newspeak,

which removes words from English

that could lead to rebellion.

It uses doublethink to control thought by,

perhaps you could say,

forcing you to hold contradictory beliefs

and accept them as true.

If not, the thought police arrest you

for committing a thoughtcrime.

Examples of doublethink are war is peace,

freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.

And finally, the Party
constantly rewrites history,

as the quote goes,

"Who controls the past
controls the future.

"Who controls the present
controls the past."

There are several
ministries, four of them,

Ministry of Truth, it's
responsible for propaganda,

and like I said, rewriting history.

Ministry of Love is responsible

for brainwashing people through torture.

Ministry of of Plenty is responsible

for rationing of food, supplies and goods.

And Ministry of Peace, of course,

is responsible for maintaining
constant state of war.

Society is divided into three levels,

the Inner Party, the Outer
Party, and the Proles,

the stands for, I guess, proletariats.

It's the working class.

The Inner Party is tiny,

the Outer Party's a little bit bigger,

and the majority of the people,

I forget what the percentage is,

maybe 80% is the the
Proles, the working class.

There's several key characters,

Winston, the main character

is a low ranking member of Ingsoc.

He works at the Ministry of Truth

where he rewrites
history, like I mentioned.

Julia is a dark-haired girl
who Winston falls in love with,

and she with him.

They have sex,

and this is maybe a good place to mention

that passionate sex,
love and passionate sex

are forbidden in the society.

Good sex, I think is
a term under Newspeak.

Hashtag good sex,

is the kind of sex that
leads to procreation,

which is the only kind
of sex that's allowed,

and the only kind of sex that's good.

O'Brien is another central character.

He's the member of the Inner Party

that convinces Winston he's
part of the Brotherhood,

which is a lie.

And he eventually is the
man who tortures Winston

and breaks his mind, breaks his heart.

Big Brother and Emmanuel Goldstein

are these symbolic characters

that we never actually get to meet.

They may and may not exist.

Big Brother is the head
of the Party Ingsoc,

and Emmanuel Goldstein is the leader

of the so-called Brotherhood,

which is this supposed mysterious group

that lurks in the shadows and
works to overthrow the Party.

Again, may or may not exist.

We'll maybe talk about
the importance of that

in a totalitarian state.

So a few key takeaways,
and I'll try to do my best.

I have disparate notes
that I took for myself.

I'll try to do my best to try
to integrate them together

to make some cohesive thoughts.

And part of the reason
I wanted to do this,

while I have read Nineteen
Eighty-Four many times in my life

and many of the books
I've put on a reading list

that I want to read, I've read many times,

I haven't often really
concretized my thoughts

about the books.

I just take the journey
and just let the thoughts

kind of wander around in the
background as I live my life.

I wanted to kind of put on paper
and maybe share with others

to see what they think,

what my concrete takeaways
are from the book,

what my thoughts are

if I could try to convert them into words.

So the first one for me,

especially later in life as
I've been reading this book,

is that when everything else,

or most things that make
you human are taken away

by those around you, by
the totalitarian state,

the last thing that's left

that is the most difficult
to take away is love.

Love for other human beings,
love for life itself.

That's the little flame
from which hope springs.

That's the key revolutionary
act is the act of love.

So when the ability to
speak is taken away,

when the ability to think
rational thoughts is taken away,

the last thing that's left,

and the thing that ultimately
gives hope is love.

That's a big takeaway for me,

and the note that Julia gives to Winston,

the note reading "I love you",

is the kind of revolutionary act

that leads to a society
beyond the one they exist in.

I think a lot of the book has
an interesting hypocrisy to it

where the main character, Winston,

is almost in an animalistic way,

obsessed with destroying the state,

in rebellion and revolution.

But I think love is the thing

that allows you to believe
in a place beyond the state

in believing that you can
build something better,

versus destroying the thing you're in.

I think you have to be
careful as a revolutionary

not to obsess 100% with destruction,

because beyond destruction,

there could be chaos that
leads to something much worse.

I think love is the thing
the the basic human thing

that connects all of us,

the messy thing that connects all of us

that allows you to build a better society

after the totalitarian one is overthrown.

What else do I wanna say?

There's an interesting tension there

between love and sex or lust.

I think there's a quote that,

"Pure love or pure lust was
impossible or forbidden."

Pure love and pure lust.

Pure here, meaning sort of unadulterated,

uncensored intensity of
feeling, maybe intimacy.

And that was an interesting
question raised by the book,

both by Winston and Julia,

what is ultimately the thing,

the most powerful act of rebellion?

Is it between us humans when
everything is forbidden?

Is it animalistic-like sex,

just lust, lust for another human?

Or is it love,

a kind of love you have
for a romantic partner,

but even love for
family, love for friends.

I don't know.

I think the book almost
claims that it is sex,

but I think what the book also shows

is if sex is your
manifestation of rebellion,

that that ultimately leads to
something that doesn't last.

That ultimately leads to
a focus on destruction

versus building beyond the
horizon when the state falls.

So some quotes from Winston on this,

"The more men you've had sex with",

so Julia admitted to have sex
with quite a lot of people.

He says, "The more men
you've had sex with,

"the more I love you.

"I hate purity, I hate virtue.

"I want everyone to be
corrupt to the bone."

This kind of rubbed me the wrong way,

because again, this seems to be obsessed

with the hatred towards the state,

versus a longing and a hope,

which I think hope is
really important here.

A hope for better future beyond the state.

Again, another quote from the book,

"Their embrace had been a
battle, the climax of victory.

"It was a blow struck against the Party.

"It was a political act."

So there again, I think
sex is a political act,

an act of political rebellion.

I think that's not the
deeply human thing here.

The deeply human thing is
again, the act of love.

It's a source of hope,

it's the catalyst for
building a better future

beyond the revolution.

An interesting side note here,

and there could be a million
interesting side notes,

and I'm desperately trying not
to go on a million tangent,

and to hold myself together
here, to stay focused,

is on family.

So there's all kinds of love,

and I think family love
is a really powerful bond

that connects us,

and that's one of the things
that the totalitarian states

really go after.

And I should actually mention,

sort of loosely using term

"authoritarian" and "totalitarian" here.

But I think to me at least, I
don't know what others think,

but to me authoritarian means

where there's a government,

a centralized, complete
centralized control

of political affairs.

And a totalitarian state is
a complete, is beyond that,

is a complete control of not just politics

and the functions of government,

the basics of the functions of government,

but also social, economic, everything.

It's, Nazi Germany's example
of that I think to me,

where there's just complete
control of every single thing,

from the war effort to
the social interactions,

the rules that govern social
interaction, to the press,

all that kind of stuff.

So I think this book is more about,

at least in my definition of the term,

about totalitarianism.

Anyway, as I was saying on family,

I think the way they destroy family,

one, of course, with
your romantic partner,

forbidding passion.

Passionate sex, but really just passion,

longing for another,
for another human being

in that romantic way.

And they also really reward
and encourage children

at a young age, they indoctrinate them,

to turn their parents in for thoughtcrime,

whether they're real or not,

which of course is a silly
notion because it doesn't,

there's no nature of truth, there's no,

you can just accuse anyone of anything

and they're guilty by just existing.

So that's a way to attack the family.

And I should also have
mentioned on the topic of love

is that I think the goal of the Party,

the final destination,

as used by O'Brien through
the process of torture,

is for to break your mind,

to break your heart and soul completely

so that the only love you can have,

and it could be felt as a
pure love is for Big Brother.

This is the kind of thing
you see in North Korea,

is that the only love
you're allowed to have,

the remaining inklings of feeling

that might still exist in you,

you can channel only,

not towards family, not
towards romantic partners,

not towards friends,
but towards this leader,

this God-like Messianic figure,

in this case who may or may not exist.

In all cases, that figure,

while there is a human associated with it,

it's really much bigger than the human.

And that's the only love
you're allowed to have.

So the other takeaway I have
is on the topic of hate.

I think all humans have the capacity,

almost an animalistic craving
for hate of the other,

the enemy.

Whether it's individuals
like Emmanuel Goldstein

or nations like Eurasia and East Asia,

which I should say are
the two other super states

described in this book

that are constantly at
war with each other.

Again, the fascinating thing

about the way this book is written

is you don't know if
Eurasia or East Asia exists.

You really don't know what
exists or what is true

beyond the local little interaction,

local little world of the main character.

And that I think is the point,
when you don't really know,

there's no steady footing on
which to construct a worldview

from which you can have
hope about a better future,

that longing for a better future.

And so this animalistic craving for hate,

or the capacity to have hate,

especially when we're in crowds,

I think is most powerfully illustrated

in the two minutes of hate,

which is practiced by the society.

And the quote is,

"The horrible thing about
the two minutes of hate

"was not that one was
obliged to act a part,

"but that it was impossible
to avoid joining in.

"Within 30 seconds, any
pretense was always unnecessary.

"A hideous ectasy of
fear and vindictiveness,

"a desire to kill, to torture,

"to smash faces in with a sledgehammer

"seemed to flow through
the whole group of people

"like an electric current,

"turning one even against one's will

"into a grimacing screaming lunatic.

"And yet the rage that one felt

"was an abstract, undirected emotion,

"which could be switched
from one object to another,

"like the flame of a blowlamp."

That's the point, is you
get the crowd together,

you get them to hate Goldstein,
or Eurasia, or East Asia,

you get them to hate anything.

And because that feeling,
that drug, that hypnotic,

that mass hypnosis that you feel

can be directed by the
state into any direction.

And because you have
complete control of history,

you can direct it on a day by
day basis towards any target.

And as long as the hate is catalyzed

to these kinds of rituals,
as long as the hate is there,

it can overpower the
individualistic feeling of love

we have for each other.

So that hate is a more animalistic desire.

I don't know what to make of it.

And of course it's also
important to say that this book,

I think I've read many places

that it was intended originally
by Orwell as a satire,

although a satire that has quite
a lot of torture at the end

and doesn't seem to have much humor.

But I think if you read it as a satire,

that's the way it's better
to understand it's relevance

in our society today.

Because a lot of things,
like two minutes of hate

is almost like a caricature

of what hate looks like
in a mass gathering.

But if you take it as a caricature,

it can now reveal you some of the elements

that already exist in human nature

that are there and that we
should be very cautious about.

So it reveals the very thing

that if not monitored by ourselves,

can result in a slippery
slope that leads to,

yeah, destruction of the tribalism,

destruction of other groups,

and then control of the
collective intelligence

of our species through
the totalitarian state.

I think there's elements of this

that are just under illustration
in social media today.

I don't wanna overstate it.

I think just like
comparing things to Hitler,

comparing things to Nineteen Eighty-Four,

I think is a reach in most cases.

But social media does reveal
this kind of mass hysteria,

this capacity of humans to be outraged,

of outrage based on tribalism.

So we have to understand it,

we have to resist giving into
it on the individual level.

And I do believe we
have the responsibility

to create technology
that helps us resist it,

that incentivizes us not
to be cruel to each other

just because all the people

in whatever tribe we define ourselves in

are being cruel to a particular person

or a particular group.

Another takeaway I have is about power.

Ingsoc, the totalitarian
states wants only one thing,

and that is power.

Power is both the means and
the end, absolute power.

That's what O'Brien describes,

and there's a lot of quotes about this

in the torture part of the book.

O'Brien says, "The real power,

"the power we have to
fight for night and day

"is not power over things,
but power over men.

"Power is inflicting pain and humiliation.

"Power is in tearing human minds to pieces

"and putting them together again

"in new shapes of your own choosing.

"Power is not a means, it is an end.

"One does not establish a dictatorship

"in order to safeguard a revolution.

"One makes the revolution

"in order to establish a dictatorship.

"The object of persecution is persecution.

"The object of torture is torture.

"The object of power is power.

"This of course is another
aspect of human nature.

"The will to power,

"and the tendency of
that power to corrupt."

O'Brien says also, "The
weariness of the cell

"is the vigour of the organism".

Through the torture of the individual,

through the breaking of the individual,

through the death of the individual

that doesn't exist
according to the history,

all of that doesn't matter.

What matters is the organism.

And there's been a lot
of brilliant comments

throughout social media and on Reddit.

I just wanna highlight
something about this

'cause I had the exact same feeling

as I was this time rereading it.

There's a comment from Reddit user

whose name is BraveSky6764.

He said, "The conversation
between Lex and Michael Levin",

who is a brilliant biologist engineer,

"came to mind when O'Brien
made an analogy to an organism

"which survives even as the
individual cells pass away.

"And the great purges are analogous

"to the cutting of a fingernail."

If you see society as an organism,

and which I think is the way
a totalitarian state sees it,

then the destruction of a large
percentage of that society,

the murder, the torture,

all kinds of atrocities in genocide

become justifiable as long
as the organism flourishes.

And that's how you get to
the ideas that Stalin had,

it's okay to break a few
eggs to make an omelet.

This devaluation of a human being

as of fundamental importance in a society,

that's a slippery slope into atrocities.

It's not just deeply unethical

from our understanding
of morals and ethics,

it is also very unproductive.

It destroys the human spirit.

And the human spirit is essential

for a building of a great
society of constant progress.

I think that's also one of
the other messages of the book

is about utopia,

that totalitarianism results
when you chase perfection,

when you chase, when you
present this idea of utopia.

There is no utopia, there
is no perfect society.

I think at least for me, that's takeaway.

I think the optimal state
of being for an individual

and for a state is a constant
turnover, constant change.

In the case of a state,

it's a constant turnover
of leaders, of ideas,

and always hopefully in the long term,

making progress towards a better world.

But it's always going to be messy.

Perfection only exists
in a oppressive state.

Perfection only exists when you remove

the basic humanity of the individuals

that make up that state,

when you destroy the human spirit.

Although when you suppress and
you destroy all the freedoms,

because freedom's going to be messy,

it's going to be very chaotic.

But that freedom ultimately

is at least in the long arc of history

is going to create progress.

So yes, as the the
Redditor, BraveSky6764 says,

that does actually give you a perspective

of a biological system

where it's a bunch of living organisms.

Each one of us are made up of
a bunch of living organisms,

and we take that for granted
of all the atrocities

that are happening there.

And we don't seem to give a damn.

I think that's a really good
metaphor for us to help,

if you want to put yourself in
the mind of the Inner Party,

of Big Brother,

of the people that are in
power in those situations,

I think a lot of them, if most
of them, if not all of them,

see themselves as doing
good for the world,

that's doing good for the society.

And they're able to justify that

the way we justify the
murder of the different cells

in our body.

You don't even think of them
as worthy of consideration.

You don't think of them as living beings,

of having the same values as you.

And that's one of the
really powerful ideas

that the founding of the United States,

that all men are created equal,

that there's an equal
worth to a human being

no matter who that human being is.

That idea, at the very least,

as flawed as its
implementations have been,

is a really, really powerful idea

and it's a non-trivial idea.

And that idea resists the
drug of totalitarianism,

the drug of power.

I do believe that on the
topic of power in politics,

that Nineteen Eighty-Four,
as I've mentioned,

has been I would say misused
by political ideologues.

I've seen it for example,

on Conservatives in the United States,

have used Nineteen Eighty-Four

to call left-wing policies Orwellian.

I think that's an overstatement,

and of course used for dramatic effect,

but it should be at least said

that Orwell was a Democratic socialist.

Nineteen Eighty-Four is not
a criticism of socialism,

it's a criticism of totalitarianism.

And I think the point is a
warning against totalitarianism

in all forms,

that all political ideologists can succumb

to the allure of power
and be corrupted by it.

And I think people on the
left in the United States

and people on the right can
both be corrupted by power.

So this kind of one way
criticism of left-wing policies

as Orwellian is a very kind
of convenient shorthand,

but the reality is all men and politicians

are capable of creating
an Orwellian world.

And I think one of the things

that is highlighted in the
book very well, I would say,

if I interpret it correctly,
is the hypocrisy of Winston.

When O'Brien asks Winston
what he's willing to do

to overthrow the Party,

what he's willing to
do for the Brotherhood,

Winston admits that he's
willing to do atrocities,

he's willing to do evil unto children,

unto anybody, murder anything.

And I think this is a
really powerful illustration

that both the totalitarian and
the blind immoral resistance,

rebellion against the totalitarian
state can both be evil.

And I think that's where I return to love

is the thing that carries hope

for a world beyond this battle,

this very important battle for freedom.

But you have to have that.

Otherwise it's the Orwellian state

and the resistance to Orwellian state

can both destroy basic
human rights and freedoms.

And I think sort of in
the character of Winston,

that's illustrated well.

And I should also mention that
there's interesting writing,

no, I'm not obviously a scholar of Orwell,

and there's a lot of books' been written,

and I should probably
recommend them somewhere.

There's just great books
written on Nineteen Eighty-Four,

on Orwell, on the historical context

in which he was operating
and all that kind of stuff.

But as far as I see Orwell,
also with Nineteen Eighty-Four

and himself politically,

he was not espousing

the complete opposite of totalitarianism.

There is, again, with
democratic socialism,

that there is value to the
connection between human beings,

that you have to lean on
each other, help each other,

that society is fundamentally
a cohesive collective

than a completely sort of disparate set

of sovereign individuals.

It's both.

And I think he was torn about that idea,

because in order to resist
a totalitarian state,

you have to fight for those
basic individual freedoms.

But at the same time, a society,
a well-functioning society

allows for that freedom to
manifest as collaboration.

And so that's the
difficult challenge there.

Again, that's why he was
a Democratic socialist,

and the criticism of the book
was against totalitarianism,

of a centralized state that
controls speech, thought,

you know, the press, and all
the basic human freedoms,

controls truth.

And I think a lot of people
would ask the question,

and I hear this tossed around,

you know, do we live in the world

of Nineteen Eighty-Four today?

And I think that's used as a shorthand

to sort of criticize different policies

and different governments.

I generally don't like the
use of that kind of language

because it's basically crying wolf.

If everything is Nineteen Eighty-Four,

if everybody is Hitler,
then you're not going to,

there's no way to kind of
properly normalize the discussion

of what's, of the lesser
of two evils kind of thing,

which is ultimately
what democracy is about.

You have a collection of
things you're picking,

they all kind of suck,

but you want to pick the
one that sucks the least.

That's human society, you know,

that's human nature, it's messy.

And so I don't think we live

in a Nineteen Eighty-Four state,

but there's a lot of elements
that this book reveals

about human nature

and about the operation
of a totalitarian state

that we should be on the watch for.

So surveillance state of doublethink,

of controlling language,

of being in a constant state of wars,

a way to control the population
and the flow of resources.

All those things have elements
of almost like useful tools

for the establishment of
complete control of a populace.

And the moment you notice those elements,

it's our job to resist those elements.

So I think the point is
we have to be vigilant

to the slippery slope of the will to power

in centralized institutions.

Another thing I wanna mention

is that I think a lot of people

rightfully complement Orwell to have,

predict some of the
elements of future society,

especially with technology,

technological capabilities that are with,

for example, telescreens used by the state

to control the population.

Maybe I can make a few comments
on technology in general.

People who criticize technology

will often use Nineteen
Eighty-Four as an example that,

you know, technology is a
tool for a totalitarian state.

It's a way they can achieve full control

and should be extremely cautious of it.

And I think that's, there's
a kernel of truth to that,

but it's not obviously
to me that on the whole,

technology is a tool for
totalitarian control,

that I think it is also
a tool for freedom.

The internet is an
incredible tool for freedom.

And so of course, we have
to fight for that freedom.

But I believe in general, the greater,

let's just take the internet
broadly as an example,

and there's a lot of sub-elements of that,

and like more sort of platonic sense

of what the internet is, which
is digital interconnectivity.

We have to fight for the
freedom, but in general,

the greater reach and access
that the internet has,

the more powerful the
resistance to totalitarianism.

Technology is a double-edged sword.

It provides the tools for oppression,

and the tools for the
ongoing fight for freedom.

And as long as the will to
fight arises in the human heart,

technology, I think, helps humanity win.

And of course there's
been a lot of discussion

about free speech and
the freedom of thought,

and there's a lot to be said
there that's much more nuanced

than the book Nineteen
Eighty-Four provides.

I think Nineteen Eighty-Four
just shows the end,

horrible conclusion of
complete totalitarian control

over speech, over thought,
over feeling, over everything.

But in general, my view of
it is kind of inspiration to,

in order to prevent ourselves

from slipping into an authoritarian

until totalitarian state,

you know, Orwellian type of
dystopias, to avoid them,

we have to value critical
and independent thought.

I think thought first
before speech, just thought.

I think you have to learn to think deeply

from first principles,

independent of whatever
tribe you find yourselves in,

independent of government,
independent of groups,

independent of the people
around you, the people you love,

that love you.

You have to learn at least
sometimes to think independently.

Now this is the Nietzsche,

"If you gaze long into the
abyss, the abyss gazes into you."

If you think too independently,
you can break your mind.

I mean, we are social creatures,
we need that connection.

But I think it's like with the Tom Waits,

"I like my Tom with a
little drop of poison".

I think of truly, deeply
independent thought

as a little drop of
poison that's necessary

for your own mind.

Most of your life you live,

you kind of assume most
things around you are true,

and that's very useful.

We stand on the shoulders of giants,

but you on a regular
occasion have to question,

question your assumption,

question your biases, question everything.

Question the things
you've taken for granted,

question what everybody's
telling you, but not too much.

It's a tricky balance.

But the act of rebellion
against the totalitarian state,

against the slippery slope into that state

is that independent thought.

And of course speech is a
manifestation of that thought.

So if to avoid echo chambers
in both thought and speech,

like I said, you have to
question your assumptions,

challenge your biases.

I think that's the way out.

Or maybe that's a resistance mechanism

to slipping into authoritarianism.

And maybe I have a few more things to say

about the latter part of the book,

the part where there's torture,

where there's room 101

that has the thing you fear the most,

which is different for all of us.

And for Winston, that's rats.

Makes you wonder what that
thing is for each of us.

I left a mental note for
myself to do more research

into the historical context,

the psychology of the neuroscience,

the effectiveness of torture.

I think there's probably
a lot of really good work.

I had a brief conversation with
Andrew Huberman on the phone

about this topic.

Andrew Huberman, the
brilliant Andrew Huberman,

host of The Huberman Lab Podcast
that you should listen to.

And then he mentioned to me

that there's a bunch of
papers in these topics

that has been studied, sort
of the carrot and the stick

of the ability of
incentives and disincentives

to control the perception
and the mental state

of people and animals.

And he mentioned to me a few
folks that I could talk to

on a podcast about this
topic and a few books,

so I'll definitely look into this more.

I think Nineteen Eighty-Four is probably,

it uses torture as a
philosophical description,

as a caricature of the operation
of a totalitarian state.

But at the same time,

a lot of those elements
were all done under Stalin

in the Soviet Union.

So it's not like it's very different

or very far from reality.

It's very, very real.

The question is about
the actual effect it has

on the human mind,

which I really have to think,

because torture in this
case breaks Winston.

In fact, I'd like to
believe that many people

in the most fundamental ways
can't be broken in this way.

I've seen science, again,
without extensively reading,

so please correct me if I'm wrong,

but I've seen science
that shows that torture,

for the purpose of intelligence
gathering is not effective.

It's not effective to
get accurate information

because people will tell
you anything, really,

to stop the torture, stop
the physical and the mental,

the emotional suffering.

So that, but I think this book
is about the use of torture

to completely break your ability to think

and to perceive the world.

One of the things I talk to Andrew about

is whether it's possible
to control perception

through these kinds of things.

And it seems that there
is literature that shows

it's possible to literally change

your perception of the world,

like in this case in Nineteen Eighty-Four,

it's when you're holding up four fingers,

can you actually make the person believe

that you're holding up five fingers,

not because of some weird delusion,

or just because your vision
is blurry or any of that,

but you literally when you
look, I'm holding four fingers,

and what you see is five fingers.

Not because your vision is poor, no.

Your visual cortex,

the way you're processing
that information,

something about the processing

changes completely your perception.

If I tell you there's a straight line,

through incentive or disincentive,

can you start seeing like a crooked line

or something like that?

Anyway, I think that there's
literature that supports that,

which is by the way, terrifying.

But the thing I'd like
to research into more

is if that can be long-lasting,

is that I just don't believe it can't be.

If you're not pushed to your
death, yes, maybe perception,

maybe your willingness to think.

But your ability to think,

your actual ability to
think independent thoughts,

maybe you're terrified.

I understand if you're terrified

of any more kind of thinking

that leads to rebellious thoughts.

Like the book mentions
the idea of facecrime

where you can reveal your thoughts,

the inner workings of your mind

by the subtleties of your
expressions in your face.

And I think also like
Winston or O'Brien says,

"If you want to keep a secret,

"you must also hide it from yourself."

So I can understand that,
I can understand that.

And maybe that is the basic
mechanism that torture leads to,

that you just learn your body,

your mind learns to hide
the truth from yourself.

Like you're not, you don't
even allow yourself to think it

because you know if you think it,

it's going to lead to
facecrime and thoughtcrime,

and that's gonna lead to more torture.

That's possible, that's possible.

But I just can't imagine
the capacity for love

in the human heart to be
extinguished through torture,

finally extinguished.

Temporarily, yes, but
finally irrecoverably,

which I think is the
basic claim of the book

that they break.

So, because through the
worst of the torture,

Winston gives up Julia,
the object of his love.

He says that, "Some things like that,

"the fact that you said
torture her, not me,

"anything to make this stop.

"The fact that you said that,
the fact that you thought that

"is a statement, is a thought

"you can't walk back to yourself.

"So it's irrecoverable.

"You just destroyed your faith in love."

I don't think so, I think it's possible,

we have to remember that this
is one particular character,

that this is one particular story.

I think there's a lot of people

in which the capacity
to love cannot be broken

no matter the torture.

But that's an interesting
scientific question,

but it's also a human question.

It's just, I think man search for meaning.

There's a lot of books that
explore these kinds of question

in the worst of conditions that
humans had to suffer through

what still persists, what
is the source of meaning?

And I just think that the
flame of love persists

through atrocities, through
torture, through suffering,

through all of it.

But the claim of the book that yes,

the totalitarian state can use
torture to break even that,

even that which leads to the only love

you're allowed to have, which
is the love for Big Brother.

So I think the, practically speaking,

from the Party perspective,

I think the point of
O'Brien's torture of Winston

was to suffocate the hope
in his mind and heart,

so there is no hope.

By completely destroying the knowledge

of what is and isn't
true, so being betrayed,

and this kind of Goldstein's
book about the society,

not knowing if that's true,

not knowing anything about Julia,

so basically having no emotional

or intellectual ground to stand on,

it's very difficult to have
like a sense of where you are.

Like to have hope, you have to
have a sense of where you are

and where things could be, and that.

And then you also betray yourself,

like to force you to be a hypocrite

on your own deepest feelings of love,

I think that basically puts you in a place

where there's no hope, there's no point.

It's apathy, it's nihilism,

and there, a hardworking member of society

that is nihilistic is
probably what the Party wants,

because that human will not rebel.

But on the point of hope,

I should mention that there's
kind of a long-running theory

that since the appendix,

the appendix is about
the details of Newspeak,

the language that the Party
is creating, enforcing,

because that appendix was
written in the past tense

and is talking about
Newspeak in the past tense,

and it's written in English,
sort of non-Newspeak,

that means the Party in Newspeak

and all of its elements
that we see in the story

is in the past.

That the world from
which the book is created

has escaped that.

And that's a message of hope,

that whatever the rebellion
against the Party,

whether it's passionate, lust
and sex, whether it's love,

whether it's the seeking truth

in a world full of lies, whatever
it is, there's a way out.

Again, to me, the way out is love.

But that's a hopeful message
in this dystopian novel

that even these perfectly
executed totalitarian states

will fall.

I took a few random notes here
that maybe I'll comment on.

I wrote a quote,

"The masses cannot rebel
until they become conscious."

That might be either a Winston observation

or an O'Brien statement, I'm not sure.

But yes, so you have to think 80% plus

are Proles, the working class.

They have the power if they want it,

but they don't want it,
they don't want to take it,

that's the whole point
of the totalitarian state

is to break your will for
freedom, your desire for freedom,

break your ability to
know that you're not free.

And that's where all of it,
the changing of history,

the doublethink, the thoughtcrime,

all of that comes into play.

That the torture in the Ministry of Love,

all of that is about
preventing the populace

from becoming conscious.

And again, as per the
cells discussion earlier,

I wrote down the O'Brien quote,

"The death of the individual is not death.

"The Party is immortal."

And this is just a interesting observation

about the operation of
a totalitarian state,

that it's the idea and a
kind of amorphous symbol

of the Messianic figure in Big Brother

is all you need for the Party to persist.

That person doesn't
actually have to exist.

Any one individual doesn't have to exist,

it's just the division of society

into high, middle, and low.

And the oppression of the low by the high,

by the centralized Inner
Party, that's all you need.

And the individual does
not matter in that.

And again, the way to fight that

is to fight for the individual freedoms.

Interesting side note is
just the quote I wrote down

from Julia, I think.

"If you keep the small rules,
you can break the big ones."

And so she, in the book,

is somebody that follows to the T,

all the rules of the Party.

She attends all the committee meetings

and all that kind of stuff,

and just is like the model citizen

from the perspective of the Party.

And so that allows her
to break the big rules,

like have passionate sex with people

like the really, or fall in love,

all the forbidden things.

And I think that's actually a good way

to exist in the world.

I think for a lot of us,

there's probably a bunch
of things that bother us

in the local world around
us, in the bigger world.

And I think you have to pick your battles.

You have to not get lost in
the muck of small battles

if you want to have at least one

or a few big victories in your life

that make for a better world.

I think at least in my sense,

it's easy to get distracted
by the little things

that bother you in life.

And I think staying
focused on the big things,

again, picking your battles,

and staying with that
for as long as possible.

Working your ass off to solve one problem

for as long as possible.

Not giving up against impossible odds,

against all the criticism, all of that,

that's the way to solve
those big problems.

And of course that's not
what Julia is talking about,

but in a sense she is also,
because in that particular case,

a totalitarian state is the problem.

And the way to rebel is to plant that seed

of rebellion in each of the
people she has sex with.

That we are human, that we
have lust for each other,

that we have the ability
to love each other.

And that is the necessary
act of rebellion there.

That is the big leap for her at least

in that kind of society.

I should also mention that
there's a lot of interpretations

of the different, the small and
the big things in this book.

So it's very possible
in the case of Julia,

that Winston was played,
he was set up with Julia.

He was set up to feel all those things.

He was set up to have
that little secret cove

where he can write on
his desk in the diary,

and dream of rebelling against the state,

dream of the Brotherhood.

It's unclear to me why an oppressive state

would want people to
have that little journey

of desiring freedom in
all its manifestations.

I'm not sure, but maybe
O'Brien's statement

that the purpose of torture
is torture, holds some wisdom.

That to attain absolute power,

you also have to have a willingness

and a mechanism to
attain absolute suffering

in the populace.

And maybe this is a way
to maximize suffering,

is to give them hope before you crush it.

Again, the way out to me, and
the takeaway from this book,

the way out is love.

Perhaps this is a good
place to also mention

a little bit of a fun,

a little controversy that
evolved over Twitter.

So I posted a reading list quickly

before heading off to a New Year's party,

of books that I hope to read in 2023.

And these are based on books
that I asked people to vote on,

and these are the ones, many
of the ones they selected.

And they happened to be many of the books

I've read many times throughout
my life and really enjoyed.

And they were like old friends

that I love visiting and revisiting,

and every time I read
them I get something new,

and they're just read
different throughout life.

You know, the way in my teens

when I read The Stranger by Camus

is very different than it was in my 20s,

and different in my 30s.

I'll say my favorite book now by Camus

is probably The Plague, and
all of that has evolved.

Dostoevsky, I read The
Idiot several times,

I read Brothers Karamazov,
both in English and Russian,

Notes from Underground.

I mean I love Dostoevsky, and
a lot of these books are just,

yes they're classics, but
they're also deeply profound,

and they move me on a intellectual level,

but also just as a human being.

They're like travel companions,

they're like old friends,
old dead friends.

So yeah, so I wanted to
celebrate my love for books,

and it was very strange to me that,

and if I'm just being honest for a second,

it was kind of painful
that some prominent figures

that I respect were kind
of cruel about the list,

and they responded, they mocked it

and all that kind of stuff,

and basically taking the
worst possible interpretation.

And I have to be honest and say it was,

it wasn't fun.

'Cause it was just, it
was just a silly kid me,

kind of in a joyful New Year's mood,

sharing with the world, books I love.

And I think what was happening,

and this seems to be happening a bit more,

is there's a bunch of people

that are just almost waiting
or hoping that I fail,

or maybe that I'm some
kind of bad human being,

and they're looking,

they're trying to discover things about me

that reveal that I'm a bad human being,

and maybe somehow this
reading list reveals that,

I don't know.

I don't know.

So one criticism was that

everybody read these books
in school, and they're basic.

I think my response to that criticism is,

no, first of all, most people
have not read them in school.

Maybe they read Cliff Notes.

And they're not basic,
they're deeply profound,

some of the greatest words ever written.

But also I don't think I've
ever gotten a lot from books

I was forced to read in school

when I had to read them
for like an assignment.

Some of these books I
think I read in school,

but most of them not.

But it's only when I read
them outside of school

on my own volition, that I
really gained a lot from it.

And especially throughout my life,

regular times as a teenager,
in my 20s and in my 30s.

So no, these books are profound
and deserve returning to.

And like I said,

they are old friends that
give me a lot of meaning

every time I return to revisit the ideas,

and they give me a new
perspective on life.

Another criticism was
very kind of nitpicky,

and the list was put
together really quickly,

and the goal, I like setting tough goals.

The goal was to read a book a week,

and you know, on one
week I had Little Prince,

followed by Brothers Karamazov.

And people criticized that
how can you possibly read

Brothers Karamazov in one week?

Maybe I won't, maybe I'll fail miserably.

But I love trying, but that
wasn't actually the goal.

I should have said, I
intend to finish reading it

by the end of that week.

So you start earlier,
'cause Little Prince takes,

you know, an hour or two to read,

and then Brothers Karamazov,
I could have the two weeks,

it should take about 30,
40, 50 hours to read it.

That said, friends,

I've read it already in
English and in Russian.

I'm interviewing the world famous,

I would say amazing translators
of Brothers Karamazov,

of Dostoevsky, of Tolstoy, Richard Pevear,

and Larissa Volokhonsky,

probably across multiple days.

So this book means a lot to me.

I'm not somebody just kind of rolling in,

what are the cool kids reading these days?

These books have been
lifelong companions to me.

And the fact that people
just wanna stomp on that,

and a large number of people
did, people I respect,

yeah, I'll be lying if I said it wasn't,

it didn't suck a bit.

Anyway, the love for reading persists.

I have to say after that,

I was very hesitant to even
make this particular video

on Orwell on Nineteen Eighty-Four.

And I'm not sure I want to
be public with my reading

after this.

And I know a lot of people will say no,

there's like, we're here with you,

we're very supportive and I love you.

I mean, I meet so many incredible people,

but the reality is it
does suck to be vulnerable

and share something with the world

and receive that kind of mockery at scale.

So I will definitely, I will
not be affected or broken

by any of that kind of stuff

for something that's actually meaningful.

Like the conversations

are some of the very
difficult conversations

I'm going to do.

But a silly side hobby thing of reading

that I do throughout my life,

for that to be a source of mockery,

I'm just gonna do that privately.

So I'm a little torn on that,

and I'll try to figure out a way.

Also I should say that that list,

like a lot of things is
kind of aspirational,

because if I take a job at a tech company,

or if I start a tech company,
or if I have to travel across,

I have to travel for extremely
difficult conversations

and really have to prepare for
them, all that kind of stuff,

I think that's going to affect my ability

to both read and enjoy reading,

which I think is a prerequisite
for this kind of reading.

But in general what I do

is I read about one hour a day of Kindle,

so on the sort of, in my
eyes, physical device.

And depending on the workout
I do, and the chores I have,

it's going to be about
two hours of audiobook.

So most of the things I do
during chores is audiobooks.

And when I run, and I usually
run about 10 to 15 miles,

so you're talking about, like
I often run over two hours.

It's like a slow pace.

Like when the days are not insane,

it gives me a chance to think,

and it gives me a chance
to listen to audiobooks.

So I love that process, it's
an escape for the world,

a chance for me to collect my thoughts.

And yeah, it's again, a
source of happiness and joy,

and I wanted to share that.

And I think you can get
quite a lot of reading done

through that process,

especially if it's book
you've read before.

It is very challenging to do
this kind of takeaway video,

or to concretize your
thoughts down on paper,

especially when you have to present them

in this kind of way.

I'm not sure I'm going to do that much,

'cause it's an extra bit of effort,

but it's also a chance to
share that joy with the world.

So to find cool people that also enjoy it,

so it's a trade off.

Anyway, you know, it's
just a temporary thing,

but it did suck for a
short amount of time,

for a few hours for a couple days.

But in general, you know,

I'll persist with my level of reading,

but I might not talk
about it publicly as much.

But again, let me sort of emphasize

that this kind of response and mockery

will not affect anything
of importance that I do.

Like, I always, I try to read comments,

I try to see criticism.

I really value, especially
high effort criticism.

I try to grow and
constantly try to improve.

But that's for things that
I take very seriously,

like the podcast conversations that I do.

But for silly things
like book lists, Spotify,

music playlists, the food I like to eat,

I don't know, what else, anything,

any fun like side thing,
it's not that important.

If it's something that others
don't enjoy, then whatever.

I'll enjoy them privately
with my friends locally here

or the people I meet.

So anyway, I love reading,
I love reading classics,

I love returning to old friends,

and in book form, and making new ones.

There's a bunch of science fiction

that I embarrassingly have
not read and would love to,

because those worlds are so meaningful

to so many of the people I'm friends with

that I can't wait to visit those worlds,

and sort of make new friends
in the form of books.

So definitely the love for books,

the love for reading persists,

and if you share in that
love, that's beautiful.

So thank you for joining
me on this journey.

Thank you for watching
this silly little video,

and I hope to see you next time.

Love you all.
